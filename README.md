# PROJECT DESCRIPTION
The project structure must include the following files:
Jupyter Notebook with: 
- Cells that perform descriptive statistics using Polars or Panda.
- Tested by using nbval plugin for pytest

Makefile with the following:
- Run all tests (must test notebook and script and lib)
- Formats code with Python blackLinks to an external site.
- Lints code with RuffLinks to an external site.
- Installs code via:  pip install -r requirements.txt
- test_script.py to test script
- test_lib.py to test library
- Pinned requirements.txt
- Gitlab Actions performs all four Makefile commands with badges for each one in the README.md

# Brief Description of Dataset

# Project Components
- Input: csv file 
- Output: working & tested function that produces the chart below & statistics pertinent to the variability of value creation in my dataset. linting data with ruff. producing 4 badges(linting, formatitng, installing, testing)

# Mathematics for Value Creation 

- Value Creation = Current Valuation of Unicorn Company - Funding Amount

- Both valuation and funding are computed in the USD currency 



# Box Plot Chart (Relationship between Value Creation & Industry)

Note that this computed the variability of value creation for each industry presented in our raw data. 

# Summary Statistics
Mean of Value Creation (in billions): 2.921073446327684
Median of Value Creation (in billions): 1.524
Standard Deviation of Value Creation (in billions): 8.133136697911187
